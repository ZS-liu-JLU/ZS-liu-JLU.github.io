<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

[cite_start]I am currently a Master's student at **City University of Hong Kong (Dongguan)** [cite: 12][cite_start], supervised by Prof. Zitong Yu[cite: 16]. [cite_start]Previously, I received my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from **Jilin University** in 2025[cite: 6, 7, 10].

[cite_start]My research interests include **Micro-expression Analysis**, **Facial Dynamics**, and **Large Models**[cite: 14, 20]. [cite_start]I am currently focusing on intelligent analysis of micro-expressions using large models and agents to identify hidden emotional states[cite: 20].

I have published papers at conferences such as CCBR.
